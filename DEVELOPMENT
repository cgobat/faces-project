   needs. The important part is to include a path were a matplotlib 0.91.4 
   resides.

eric4
----- 
Support for eric4 is in 'matplotlib91' branch.

I had problem with setting PYTHONPATH within eric4 (4.1.6). If you know you to 
do this reliably drop me a email.

In the meantime:

1. Start eric4.

2. 'Open Project' and choose file faces-project.e4p

3. Copy bin/faces_eric4_aanno.py and edit the copy to your needs. The important 
   part is to include a path were a matplotlib 0.91.4 resides.

4. Use your copy of the start script to run/debug faces-project from within
   eric4.
