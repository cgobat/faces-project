Installation Instruction
========================
faces-project is a project management tool written in
python. Homepage is at http://faces.homeip.net .

This is a short installation instruction. Tested on a
gentoo linux (x86_64) system.

Quick
=====
> python setup.py build
and as root
> python setup.py install

You will normally have trouble with this. Please read on.

Dependencies
============
faces-project requires:

- python 2.5.2 
- wxpython 2.8.8.1 (wxpython 2.6 should also work)
- numpy 1.1.0 (numpy 1.0.x should also work)
- cheetah 2.0.1 

You should install this on your computer (gentoo: emerge).

Known Problems
==============
You need an *old* version of matplotlib  (0.90.1).  To 
use this for faces-project (and *not* installing it for
the rest of the system) do the following:

- install faces 0.11.7 and matplotlib 0.90.1 on a 
  *different* prefix (e.g. 
  'python setup.py install --prefix=/home/pasch/mypython') 
 
- patch /home/pasch/mypython/lib64/python2.5/site-packages/matplotlib/numerix/ma/__init__.py 
  line 12: from numpy.ma import * (instead of 'from numpy.core.ma import *') 
 
- Set the environment variable PYTHONPATH according to your 
  installation dir (e.g. 
  'export PYTHONPATH=/home/pasch/mypython/lib64/python2.5/site-packages/') 
 
- run '/home/pasch/mypython/bin/faces'
